! --------------<DESCRIPTION>-------------------
! Keep in mind that my xmodmap is some clunky result of searching my keymapping so definitely not a neat solution
! I'm changing left alt key to mode switch and caps lock to alt key becuase who uses caps lock anyway just press the god damn shift
! With mod switches ... eg. <keyname> for <explanation>
! 0. <Alt_L>			for Moe_switch key
! 1. <H> 				for home
! 2. <Colon>(;) 		for end
! 3. <i, j, k, l> 		for (up, left, down, right) respectively
! 4. <Y> 				for Esc or escape key
! 5. <U>				for Backspace key
! 6. <O>				for Delete key
! 7. <Q>				for Backslash
! 8. <N>				for Pageup for prior key
! 8. <M>				for Page down for Next key
! 9. <Caps_Lock>		for Alt_L key
! 10. <A>				for Ampersand
! 11. <S>				for Asterisk
! 12. <D>				for Dollar
! 13. <F>				for Percentage
! 14. <E>				for Equal
! 15. <W>				for Minus
! --------------<DESCRIPTION/>------------------
! Alt_L -> Mode_switch
! You should clear special key you want to change bofore assigning 
! mod1 means Alt_L of keysyms for example
! Btw, keycode can be detected with xev command just open up your terminal and type xev to find out.
! Key code mapping table's format is followed by ...
! keycode <number> = <normal key> <key pressed with shift> <key pressed with mode switch> <key pressed with shift and mode switch>
clear lock 
clear mod1
keycode 64 = Mode_switch
keycode 44 = j J Left
keycode 45 = k K Down
keycode 31 = i I Up
keycode 46 = l L Right
keycode 30 = u U BackSpace
keycode 32 = o O Delete
keycode 43 = h H Home
keycode 29 = y Y Escape
keycode 47 = semicolon colon End
keycode 57 = n N Prior
keycode 58 = m M Next
keycode 24 = q Q backslash
keycode 66 = Alt_L
keycode 38 = a A ampersand
keycode 39 = s S asterisk
keycode 40 = d D dollar
keycode 41 = f F percent
keycode 26 = e E equal
keycode 25 = w W minus
! and after assinging you sould assign functionatly again
! Still doesn't get about the mechanism in here, but it works anyway... so yeah
add lock = Caps_Lock
add mod1 = Alt_L Alt_R
