# My linux or applications recommendations

## Distribution
**Pop\_Os (currently 19.10)**  
Pop os is ubuntu based distribution with gnome desktop enviornment. Pop os comes with prebuilt drivers all including amd, nvidia, intel and even vulkan's. I highly recommend pop os to new linux users, linux gamers or corportate program uers.
## Linux Setting

### Useful linux startup tips

-> **Man, manual with pdf, less pager to scroll**

### Keyboard Input 
**[Ibus + Ibus-hangul**]  
I personally use ibus since it comes with ubuntu and works pretty well with hangul(or Korean).

-> **Add some ibus setup guide for hangul users**
***

**[Xmodmap]**  
I mapped <**I,J,K,L**> to arrow keys for only keyboard control and added some more keymappings for easy navigation.

-> **Possibly add some intuitve image here**  
If you want to watch detailed keymaps see .Xmodmap file.
